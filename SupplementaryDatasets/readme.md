### Bifurcating Hydrogenase BLASTp hits

BLASTp hits of N. lanati to the bifurcating hydrogenase of T. maritima are shown here. 
The high homology hits suggest that N. lanati possibly possesses a bifurcating hydrogenase. 
The corresponding sequences can be found here under `Supplementary Data 2 - Bifurcating hydrogenase hits in N. lanati.fasta`.
