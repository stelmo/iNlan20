The central stalk, also called rotor shaft, is often seen as part of F(1) (PubMed:27373333). The peripheral stalk is seen as part of F(0) (PubMed:27373333). F(0) contains the membrane channel next to the rotor (PubMed:27373333). F-type ATP synthases form dimers but each monomer functions independently in ATP generation (PubMed:27373333). The dimer consists of 17 different polypeptides: ATP1 (subunit alpha, 3 molecules per monomer, part of F(1)), ATP2 (subunit beta, 3 copies per monomer, part of F(1)), ATP3 (subunit gamma, part of the central stalk), ATP4 (subunit b, part of the peripheral stalk), ATP5/OSCP (subunit 5/OSCP, part of the peripheral stalk), ATP6 (subunit a, part of the peripheral stalk), ATP7 (subunit d, part of the peripheral stalk), ATP8 (subunit 8, part of the peripheral stalk), OLI1 (subunit c, part of the rotor, 10 molecules per monomer), ATP14 (subunit h, part of the peripheral stalk), ATP15 (subunit epsilon, part of the central stalk), ATP16 (subunit delta, part of the central stalk), ATP17 (subunit f, part of the peripheral stalk), ATP18 (subunit i/j, part of the peripheral stalk), ATP19 (subunit k, dimer-specific, at interface between monomers), ATP20 (subunit g, at interface between monomers), TIM11 (subunit e, at interface between monomers) (PubMed:27373333, PubMed:25759169). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25759169, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27373333}.
