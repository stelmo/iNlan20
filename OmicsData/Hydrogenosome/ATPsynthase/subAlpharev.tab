C0HK51	ATPA_PICAN	ATP synthase subunit alpha, mitochondrial	Pichia angusta (Yeast) (Hansenula polymorpha)	510		ATP1			SUBUNIT: F-type ATP synthases have 2 components, the catalytic core F(1) and the membrane-embedded component F(0), linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk (PubMed:27791192). The central stalk, also called rotor shaft, is often seen as part of F(1) (PubMed:27791192). The peripheral stalk is seen as part of F(0). F(0) contains the membrane channel next to the rotor (PubMed:27791192). F-type ATP synthases form dimers but each monomer functions independently in ATP generation (By similarity). The dimer consists of 18 different polypeptides: ATP1 (subunit alpha, part of F(1), 3 molecules per monomer), ATP2 (subunit beta, part of F(1), 3 molecules per monomer), ATP3 (subunit gamma, part of the central stalk), ATP4 (subunit b, part of the peripheral stalk), ATP5/OSCP (subunit 5/OSCP, part of the peripheral stalk), ATP6 (subunit a, part of the peripheral stalk), ATP7 (subunit d, part of the peripheral stalk), ATP8 (subunit 8, part of the peripheral stalk), OLI1 (subunit c, part of the rotor, 10 molecules per monomer), ATP14 (subunit h, part of the peripheral stalk), ATP15 (subunit epsilon, part of the central stalk), ATP16 (subunit delta, part of the central stalk), ATP17 (subunit f, part of the peripheral stalk), ATP18 (subunit i/j, part of the peripheral stalk) (PubMed:27791192, PubMed:25759169). Dimer-specific subunits are ATP19 (subunit k, at interface between monomers), ATP20 (subunit g, at interface between monomers), TIM11 (subunit e, at interface between monomers) (By similarity). Also contains subunit L (PubMed:25759169). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q6C326, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25759169, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27791192}.
